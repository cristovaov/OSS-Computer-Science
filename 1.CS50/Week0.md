#### *Computer Science = Science of Computation*

## Overview

### Binary

Computers use only 1's and 0's (binary) whereas we as humans use decimals: 5, 7, 13, 42, ...  

Each 1 and 0 are bits. Bits is short for binary digit.

| 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |  DEC  |
|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-----:|
|  0 |  0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |   5   |
|  0 |  0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |   7   |
|  0 |  0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |  13   |
|  1 |  0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |  42   |

First line are power of twos.

### ASCII

Consistent standard that maps letters of the alphabet to patterns of bits adopted by the computer world.

[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)]

### Algorithms

Algortihms are sets of instructions that solve a problem.  
Inputs are passed to an algorithm which in turn will produce an output.

These *algortithms* can be presented in a linear fashion.

### Pseudocode

Generic way of describing an algorithm or a computer program just using English, with which any human might be familiar. 

```
