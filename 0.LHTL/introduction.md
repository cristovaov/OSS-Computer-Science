## Introduction: Focused and diffuse modes
There are two fundamental modes of thinking:
- **focused mode:**   
With a familiar problem, you understand and know each step needed for solving it.

- **diffuse mode:**  
When faced with something new, you look at 'the bigger picture' and allow your thoughts to take longer steps to map out ways to solve and understand the problem or concept.

You can not be in both at the same time, you are either in one or the other.  
Being in one mode limits access to the other.
