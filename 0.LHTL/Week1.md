## Introduction: Focused and Diffuse Modes

There are two fundamental modes of thinking:
- **Focused mode:**   
With a familiar problem, you understand and know each step needed for solving it.

- **Diffuse mode:**  
When faced with something new, you look at 'the bigger picture' and allow your thoughts to take longer steps to map out ways to solve and understand the problem or concept.

You can not be in both at the same time, you are either in one or the other.  
Being in one mode limits access to the other.

## Course Objectives

By the end of the course, it is expected to be able to do the following:

- Explain the difference between focused and diffuse modes of thinking.
- Explain what a chunk is, and how and why you can and should enhance your chunking skills.
- Explain how working memory and long term memory differ from one another.
- Describe key techniques to help students learn most efficiently such as: pomodoro, metaphor, story, visualization, deliberate practice, and interleaving.
- Describe actions that hinder students from learning most effectively such as procrastination, over-learning, Einstellung, choking, multi-tasking, illusions of learning, and lack of sleep.
- Describe the most important aspects of proper test preparation.
Explain the importance of “mindset” in learning.

## Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes

Learning something difficult can take time and requires practice.

Metaphors and alternating from diffuse mode to focused proves to be prowerful techniques in learning. From examples of Dali and Edison, you get to know how they would juggle from one to the other.

## What Is Learning?

More specifically: what is inside the brains that makes you learn? 

Day to day things taken for granted such as writing, seeing or walking are actually complex calculations memorized in unconcious parts of the brain.

Looking inside the brain you will see million billions of synapses trained over time, storing these memories.

Contrary to what was previously believed, recent studies discovered that synapses continue to form throughout aging. Sleep, further research showed, is an important stimulant for synapses. It will help increase the brain to retain information.

William Shakespeare has a near perfect analogy about how sleep allows synapses to be formed and help the learning process:  
> "Sleep that soothes away all our worries. Sleep that puts each day to rest. Sleep that relieves the 
> weary laborer and heals hurt minds. Sleep, the main course in life’s feast, and the most nourishing."  
*Macbeth | Act 2, Scene 2, Page 3 (Modern text)*

## A Procastination Preview

When observing a task we do not enjoy the part of the brain that is associated with pain will activate. The unease experienced is what makes us funnel that said task, focusing on something more pleasant instead.

However if you'd actually start the disliked task, you'll find that the neural uncomfortable feeling will dissipate over a certain time.

A particularily useful tool to avoid procrastination is the Pomodoro technique:  
- Set a timer for 25 minutes
- Avoid all interruptions
- Focus on the task at hand
- More importantly: *allow yourself a reward at the end of these intense 25 minutes.* :wink:

## Practice Makes Permanent

An abstract problem is hard to come to grips with it.
It is therefore important to practice during the learning process of that abstract subject.
 
As the more you practice over it, neural thought patterns are enhancing and strenghtening themselves; effectively making your hard subject easier to solve. Practicing when learning something new is what you would do in *focused mode*.

And at some point you will want to make time for a break. You take a moment for relaxation or to focus on something else. This way your brain's *diffuse mode* will have the chance to work in the background, unconciously bettering your conceptual understanding of what you are learning.

The pomodoro technique can help as well during your studies to remind you to take the time for the brain to rest and do its magic instead of cramming the problem in your head.


<br>
## The Importance of Sleep in Learning

Being awake creates toxic products in the brain. These toxins are what make you not think very clearly.

Sleep is essential to get rid of these toxins. When sleeping 'paths' in your brain relax, allowing these toxins to wash away. With a clear path the brain has space to process new information and cement the neural patterns created during your *focused mode*.
